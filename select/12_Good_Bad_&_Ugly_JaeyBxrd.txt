I'm well equipped for the grave shift
You know the simple shit to make me tick
I can see the eclipse from the hillside
Lost in the mix
I found a ripple in the matrix

Who's to say what lies between us
Who's to say what's done is done
You're too far gone for Jesus
But I could be your savior if you're praying for one

Say
Say you love
Say you love
Say you love me
If you want
Want it all
All the good
Bad and ugly
When I wake
Waking up
On the dark
On the dark side of the bed
With demons in my head
Until we meet again
Say
Say you love
Say you love
Say you love me
If you want
Want it all
All the good
Bad and ugly
When I wake
Waking up
On the dark
On the dark side of the bed
With demons in my head
Until we meet again

There's something bout the energy
That makes me wanna stay
I've been running from myself but I know
That you love to chase
Can you keep the pace
Would you hit the brakes
If you seen all the pain
Written on a n*gga face yeah

Who's to say what lies between us
Who's to say what's done is done
You're too far gone for Jesus
But I could be your savior if you're praying for one

Say
Say you love
Say you love
Say you love me
If you want
Want it all
All the good
Bad and ugly
When I wake
Waking up
On the dark side of the bed
With demons in my head
Until we meet again
Say
Say you love
Say you love
Say you love me
If you want
Want it all
All the good
Bad and ugly
When I wake
Waking up
On the dark side of the bed
With demons in my head
Until we meet again

Until we meet again
