What's with all the back
and forth, mmm, lately?
Shots fired,
love and war with you daily
You've been on my heart,
it's hardly beating, baby
You don't wanna be alone,
but we can't get along
Are you drinking to get numb?
So don't have to hold your tongue
Are you filling up your lungs
with the smoke 'cause you're done?
Am I out of my mind?
Are the thoughts really mine
Or just overthinking?
Tell me what it is,
wallow in your bliss
I'm not in a hurry, ooh-wee
And if you ain't in a mood,
then I swear it's cool
Don't worry
Don't even gotta get over it
Just lay your head
(Just lay your head)
No, I should probably quit
while ahead
I stay instead
(I stay instead)
I'll even let you run me down
to the ground
Walk to you while you run
your mouth, I stick around
I love you 'cause you love me
Through the good, bad, and ugly
Used to be frustrated,
get off work and take it out on me
Oh, yeah
Couldn't peel you off,
it was like you melted in me
What happened to the moaning?
Always been my favorite melody
Now it's always too late,
too tough, you fall asleep
Are you drinking to get numb?
So don't have to hold your tongue
Are you filling up your lungs
with the smoke
'cause you're done?
Am I out of my mind?
Are the thoughts really mine
Or just overthinking?
Tell me what it is,
wallow in your bliss
I'm not in a hurry, ooh-wee
And if you ain't in a mood,
then I swear it's cool
Don't worry
Don't even gotta get over it
Just lay your head
(Just lay your head)
No, I should probably quit
while ahead
I stay instead
(I stay instead)
I'll even let you run me down
to the ground
Walk to you while you run
your mouth, I stick around
I love you 'cause you love me
Through the good, bad, and ugly
