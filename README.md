[00:00.18] What's with all the back and forth, mm, lately?
[00:03.39] Shots fired, love and war with you daily
[00:06.39] You've been on my heart, it's hardly beating, baby
[00:10.00] You don't wanna be alone, but we can't get along
[00:34.00] 
[00:14.94] Are you drinking to get numb?
[00:16.38] So don't have to hold your tongue
[00:18.16] Are you filling up your lungs with the smoke 'cause you're done?
[00:21.56] Am I out of my mind? Are the thoughts really mine
[00:24.72] Or just overthinking?
[00:35.22] 
[00:28.45] Tell me what it is, wallow in your bliss
[00:30.92] I'm not in a hurry, ooh-wee
[00:34.77] And if you ain't in a mood, then I swear it's cool
[00:38.31] Don't worry
[00:43.81] 
[00:40.55] Don't even gotta get over it
[00:43.28] Just lay your head (just lay your head)
[00:47.43] No, I should probably quit while ahead
[00:49.99] I stay instead (I stay instead)
[00:54.05] I'll even let you run me down to the ground
[00:57.37] Walk to you while you run your mouth, I stick around
[01:00.51] I love you 'cause you love me
[01:03.69] Through the good, bad, and ugly
[01:19.19] 
[01:08.38] Used to be frustrated, get off work and take it out on me
[01:12.80] Oh, yeah
[01:14.82] Couldn't peel you off, it was like you melted in me
[01:21.40] What happened to the moaning? Always been my favorite melody
[01:27.82] Now it's always too late, too tough, you fall asleep
[01:53.82] 
[01:34.79] Are you drinking to get numb?
[01:36.26] So don't have to hold your tongue
[01:38.13] Are you filling up your lungs with the smoke 'cause you're done?
[01:41.54] Am I out of my mind? Are the thoughts really mine
[01:44.65] Or just overthinking?
[01:55.15] 
[01:48.21] Tell me what it is, wallow in your bliss
[01:50.82] I'm not in a hurry, ooh-wee
[01:54.64] And if you ain't in a mood, then I swear it's cool
[01:58.41] Don't worry
[02:03.91] 
[02:00.65] Don't even gotta get over it
[02:03.32] Just lay your head (just lay your head)
[02:07.57] No, I should probably quit while ahead
[02:09.61] I stay instead (I stay instead)
[02:13.93] I'll even let you run me down to the ground
[02:17.12] Walk to you while you run your mouth, I stick around
[02:20.44] I love you 'cause you love me
[02:23.72] Through the good, bad, and ugly
